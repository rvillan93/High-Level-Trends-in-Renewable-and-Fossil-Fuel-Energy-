#Abstract
	Oil prices are highly volatile and experience large gains and losses in price per barrel due to changes in supply and demand.However, changes in supply and demand are not always natural. In fact many times supply and demand is controlled to keep prices steady for oil dependent economies
like those who are member of OPEC. Other times demand is decreased by unexpected or "Black Swan" events like the 9/11 terrorist attacks or the current COVID-19 Pandemic. Since 2000 events such as those just mentioned have occured and had great influence on the price of oil according to the
Energy Information Administration they are:

- 2001-09-11 ,9-11 attacks
- 2005-03-01 ,Low spare capacity
- 2008-10-01 ,Global financial collapse
- 2009-03-01 ,OPEC cuts production targets 4.2 mmbpd
- 2015-03-01 ,OPEC production quota unchanged
- 2020-03-01 ,Global pandemic reduces oil demand

These unexpected events are extremely hard to predict and cause several company's to go bankrupt during these "Boom and Bust" cycles. In recent times, the oil industry's woes have been compounded by Climate Change. Citizens and investors are no longer
on the sidelines are actively supporting tougher Climate Change legislation such as the Paris Agreement and investors are becoming activists themselves such as Engine Number 1, an activist investment firm. These movments have spurred long term commitment to a transition to clean energy
in order to keep climate change uner 2 degrees celsius. This means oil will be phased out by renewables such as wind and solar energy. But how fast? and at the current rate, which energy sources are favored? how long will oil prices be high enough to sustain oil producers? 
In this high level overview we will look at visualizations gathered from the EIA API to analyze trends using visualizations using the Plotly graphing library in Python to help answer these questions. Further we will look at the viability of using Facebook Prophet, a forecasting algorithm
to see if we are able to forecast oil benchmark spot prices in order to see if oil prices will decline in the near future (2 years). These forecasts will be compared to the EIA short term forecast which is based on fundamental analysis for benchmarking and comparison. Enjoy!
